<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Flag_of_Switzerland.svg" alt="swiss flag" width="100"/>

This quickstart will help you get up & running with the Swiss LLM models built by the [**Swiss National AI Initiative  (SNAI)**](https://swiss-ai.org), on Azure.

**Note:** As the models are very new, this is a living documentation and will be updated frequently as more information gets publicly available about the models. If you find any errors or inconsistencies, please open a pull request.



## Features
This quickstart provides the following support:

* Instructions on how to download the model from HuggingFace
* Provision suitable _Spot instances_ in your Azure Subscription
* Guidance on how to deploy and serve the model for local inference
