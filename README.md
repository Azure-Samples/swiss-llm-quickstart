## What is APERTUS

[**Swiss National AI Initiative  (SNAI)**](https://swiss-ai.org) has released [**Apertus**](https://www.swiss-ai.org/apertus), Switzerland‚Äôs first large-scale open, multilingual language model ‚Äî a milestone in generative AI for transparency and diversity. Trained on 15 trillion tokens across more than 1,000 languages ‚Äì 40% of the data is non-English ‚Äì Apertus includes many languages that have so far been underrepresented in LLMs, such as Swiss German, Romansh, and many others. Apertus serves as a building block for developers and organizations for future applications such as chatbots, translation systems, or educational tools.

The model is named Apertus ‚Äì Latin for ‚Äúopen‚Äù ‚Äì highlighting its distinctive feature: the entire development process, including its architecture, model weights, and training data and recipes, is openly accessible and fully documented.


## Run APERTUS on Microsoft Azure

This quickstart will help you get up & running with the Swiss LLM models built by the [**Swiss National AI Initiative  (SNAI)**](https://swiss-ai.org), on Azure.

**Note:** As the models are very new, this is a living documentation and will be updated frequently as more information gets publicly available about the models. If you find any errors or inconsistencies, please open a pull request.

## Deployment Instructions

We provide several ways of host the model on Azure:

| Azure Host Service                                                           | Model version | Status      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  | ------------- | ----------- |
