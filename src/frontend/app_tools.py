"""Semantic Kernel plugin wrappers and registry helpers for Chainlit tools.

This module keeps tool implementations separate from the chat application so
they can be maintained and extended independently. Each plugin is registered
with Semantic Kernel and exposed through a simple registry map that the app can
use when it needs to manually dispatch tool calls.
