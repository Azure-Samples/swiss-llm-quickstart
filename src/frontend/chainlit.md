# Welcome to APERTUS on Azure! 🚀🇨🇭

Hi there, AI Enthusiast! 👋 You're now chatting with **Apertus** - Switzerland's first large-scale open, multilingual language model - running on Microsoft Azure!

## What is APERTUS? 🤔

Apertus (Latin for "open") is a groundbreaking achievement from the [Swiss National AI Initiative (SNAI)](https://swiss-ai.org). This isn't just any LLM - it's been trained on a whopping 15 trillion tokens across more than 1,000 languages! 

What makes it special? 40% of its data is non-English, including languages that have been underrepresented in LLMs until now, like Swiss German, Romansh, and many others. Talk about linguistic diversity! 🌍

## This is an Azure Implementation Example! ☁️

What you're experiencing right now is **Apertus running on Microsoft Azure** - demonstrating how easily you can deploy and interact with this Swiss marvel in the cloud! Azure's powerful infrastructure makes hosting these sophisticated models a breeze.

## Behind the Scenes 🛠️

The entire development process of Apertus - including its architecture, model weights, training data, and recipes - is openly accessible and fully documented. That's transparency at its finest!
